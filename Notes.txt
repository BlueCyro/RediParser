RediParser notes


# Where to start?

Let's break down the first simple steps of the REDIS protocol:

* Simple send/receive, clients send in data, server sends response

* Data is formatted as such
    - Encoded in binary
    - First byte determines type in RESP payload (`+` for string, `-` for error, `$` for bulk string, etc.)
    - Types are classified as `simple` or `bulk` (aggregate)
        - `simple` classifies simple values like float, int, bool, etc.
        - Strings can either be `simple` or `bulk`
        - `simple` strings are used for short messages 
        - `bulk` strings are used for any type of data
